# Comment_box

## Purpose
This project called for a section that would allow users to submit a comment and could collect a username and email address.
I chose to style it as a simple chatbox and use the username and email input to serve as an individual login. While this wasn't strictly called for in the brief it made sense within the spirit of the project and added a bit to the challenge, which I feel helped my learning during the application process.

## Usability
The page prompts users to first log in by filling in the username and email fields. In this case, the email field can be left blank, but users cannot log in without submitting a username.

Once logged in, users can type and submit as many comments as they want. Each comment will be displayed below the previous within the chat box and will show the name of the user commenting. Logging out disables the ability to comment but allows users to submit a new username if they choose to.
